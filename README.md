## Getting started:
1. Make sure below configurations are made in environment variables or .env file
2. Make sure the database specified (`DB_NAME`) exists and is accessible by the given user (and the user has the correct password)
3. Run `npm install` (first time and any time modules might have updated)
4. Run `npm start` (this will generate the database and then run the server)
5. If not already there run query for any required initial data

## Configurations
* Configurations are read from an environment variables in: src\configurations.ts
* These environment can be set by the system or by a .env file located at the root of this project (gitignored), .env expects key-value pairs with no space (i.e. `SERVER_PORT=8080`)
* You can not include or leave these values blank to get default values (however there is a configuration which defaults to true in production that the app will crash when missing configurations)
